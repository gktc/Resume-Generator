# Resume Generation Requirements

## Issue
Resume generation is stuck at 30% because there's no profile data to generate a resume from.

## Current Profile Status
- Work Experience: 0
- Education: 0
- Skills: 0
- Projects: 0

## Solution: Add Profile Data First

### Option 1: Upload an Existing Resume (Recommended)
1. Go to Profile Dashboard
2. Click "Upload Resume"
3. Upload your PDF/DOCX resume
4. Review the parsed data
5. Click "Confirm" to save to your profile
6. Then try generating a resume again

### Option 2: Manually Add Profile Data
1. Go to Profile Dashboard
2. Add at least:
   - 1-2 Work Experiences
   - 1 Education entry
   - 5-10 Skills
3. Then try generating a resume again

## How Resume Generation Works

1. **Content Selection** - Selects relevant experiences/skills from your profile based on the job description
2. **Content Optimization** - Uses AI to optimize the content for ATS
3. **ATS Score Calculation** - Calculates how well your resume matches the job
4. **LaTeX Compilation** - Generates a professional PDF resume

**Without profile data, the process cannot proceed beyond the initial stage.**

## Next Steps

1. First, populate your profile with data (upload resume or add manually)
2. Then return to Resume Generator
3. Enter job description
4. Select template
5. Generate resume

The generation should complete successfully once you have profile data!
